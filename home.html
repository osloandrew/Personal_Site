        About Me
    </h2>
    <img src="Images/andrew.jpg" id="andrew">
    <p>Hi! My name is Andrew, and I'm an Applied Computer Science student at OsloMet.</p>
    <p>I come from the town of Brookline, Massachusetts, USA. When I was in high school, I developed a deep passion for languages. I learned French, Latin, and German through classes and Norwegian on my own.</p>
    <p>I studied Political Science, German, and Geographic Information Systems at Macalester College in Saint Paul, Minnesota. I studied abroad in Berlin and Vienna, where I took intensive German classes at the C1 level.</p>
    <p>After my undergraduate studies, I gained valuable experience in IT through a front-end web development internship at Brandography in Minneapolis and a contract position at Apple Maps in California.</p>
    <p>I moved to Norway in 2016 to pursue a master's degree in globalization, transnationalism and culture at NTNU in Trondheim. I had the opportunity there to intern for the US Department of State in the FSI School of Language Studies.</p>
    <p>After I graduated, I moved to Japan for three years to teach English at the high-school level. I became proficient in Japanese and gained invaluable international experience.</p>
    <p>I returned to Norway in summer of 2021 to further my education in IT. I am studying applied computer science at OsloMet. After my studies, I plan to pursue a career in web development.</p>
